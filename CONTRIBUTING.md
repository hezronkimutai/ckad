## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **New Questions**: Add practice questions for any CKAD domain
- **Improved Solutions**: Enhance existing solutions with better explanations
- **Bug Fixes**: Fix errors in questions, solutions, or documentation
- **Documentation**: Improve README files, guides, and explanations
- **Templates**: Enhance question and solution templates
- **Scripts**: Add validation or automation scripts

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ckad.git
   cd ckad
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-deployment-question
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following the guidelines below
5. **Test your changes** on a real Kubernetes cluster
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## Question Guidelines

### Content Requirements

- **Exam Relevance**: Questions must align with official CKAD curriculum
- **Practical Focus**: Scenarios should reflect real-world use cases
- **Clear Objectives**: Each question should have specific, measurable goals
- **Appropriate Difficulty**: Difficulty level should match the complexity
- **Time Estimates**: Realistic time limits based on actual testing

### Domain Distribution

Target roughly equal distribution across CKAD domains:
- Domain 1: Application Design and Build (20%)
- Domain 2: Application Deployment (20%)
- Domain 3: Application Observability and Maintenance (15%)
- Domain 4: Application Environment, Configuration and Security (25%)
- Domain 5: Services and Networking (20%)

### Difficulty Levels

- **Basic (B)**: Single concept, 5-10 minutes, minimal setup
- **Intermediate (I)**: Multiple concepts, 10-20 minutes, moderate complexity
- **Advanced (A)**: Complex scenarios, 20+ minutes, multiple components

## Question Structure

### Directory Naming

Follow this pattern: `question-[number]-[topic]-[difficulty]`

Examples:
- `question-001-pod-creation-B`
- `question-015-deployment-rollback-I`
- `question-032-networkpolicy-debug-A`

### Required Files

```
question-XXX-topic-difficulty/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Problem statement
â”œâ”€â”€ solution/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md               # Step-by-step solution
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands.sh             # kubectl commands
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ manifests/              # YAML files
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ *.yaml
â””â”€â”€ examples/
    â””â”€â”€ sample-output.txt       # Expected outputs
```

### Using Templates

1. **Copy templates** from the `templates/` directory
2. **Customize content** by replacing all `[placeholder]` text
3. **Follow naming conventions** consistently
4. **Test thoroughly** before submitting

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] All commands tested on a live Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] YAML manifests are syntactically correct
- [ ] Solutions produce expected results
- [ ] Verification steps work correctly
- [ ] Cleanup commands remove all created resources

### Documentation Standards

- [ ] Clear, unambiguous problem statements
- [ ] Step-by-step solutions with explanations
- [ ] Expected outputs for each major step
- [ ] Common mistakes and troubleshooting tips
- [ ] Proper grammar and spelling

### Technical Standards

- [ ] Use current stable Kubernetes versions
- [ ] Follow Kubernetes naming conventions
- [ ] Include proper labels and annotations
- [ ] Use appropriate resource requests/limits
- [ ] Follow security best practices

## Submission Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your question** on multiple Kubernetes distributions if possible
2. **Validate YAML** syntax using `kubectl apply --dry-run=client`
3. **Check timing** - verify your time estimates are realistic
4. **Review templates** - ensure all placeholders are replaced
5. **Run validation scripts** (if available) to check quality
