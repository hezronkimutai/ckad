# Active Context - CKAD Questions Repository

## Current Work Focus
Creating a comprehensive CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) questions repository modeled after the existing KCNA repository structure. This is the initial project setup phase.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Established project brief and technical context
- Defined system patterns and architecture approach

## Next Steps
1. Create the main repository structure with domain-based directories
2. Set up the main README.md with project overview and navigation
3. Create question templates and contribution guidelines
4. Implement the first set of sample questions across all domains
5. Add setup scripts and documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Repository Organization
- **Domain-First Structure**: Organizing by CKAD exam domains for systematic study
- **Consistent Question Format**: Standardized structure for all questions
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Clear labeling system (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)
- **Practical Focus**: Every question should involve hands-on Kubernetes operations

### Content Strategy
- **Exam Alignment**: Questions mapped to current CKAD curriculum
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Context-driven problems rather than abstract exercises
- **Complete Solutions**: Step-by-step solutions with explanations
- **Verification Focus**: Clear success criteria for each question

### Quality Standards
- **Cluster Tested**: All examples verified against live Kubernetes
- **Version Compatibility**: Target current stable Kubernetes versions
- **Documentation Quality**: Clear, unambiguous instructions
- **Community Friendly**: Easy contribution process

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Question Structure Pattern
```
question-[number]-[topic]-[difficulty]/
├── README.md              # Problem statement
├── solution/
│   ├── README.md          # Step-by-step solution
│   ├── manifests/         # YAML files
│   └── commands.sh        # kubectl commands
└── examples/
    └── sample-output.txt  # Expected outputs
```

### Difficulty Classification
- **Basic (B)**: Single concept, 5-10 minutes
- **Intermediate (I)**: Multiple concepts, 10-20 minutes  
- **Advanced (A)**: Complex scenarios, 20+ minutes

### Domain Coverage Priority
1. Domain 4 (Environment/Config/Security) - 25% weight
2. Domain 1 (Application Design/Build) - 20% weight
3. Domain 2 (Application Deployment) - 20% weight
4. Domain 5 (Services/Networking) - 20% weight
5. Domain 3 (Observability/Maintenance) - 15% weight

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Success Factors
- **Practical Relevance**: Questions should reflect real CKAD exam scenarios
- **Clear Navigation**: Easy to find questions by domain, topic, or difficulty
- **Complete Coverage**: All exam objectives thoroughly addressed
- **Community Value**: High-quality resource for the Kubernetes community

### Technical Considerations
- **Kubernetes Compatibility**: Support multiple distributions (kind, minikube, cloud)
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Standard tools only (kubectl, YAML)
- **Cross-Platform**: Work on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Automation Ready**: Scripts for setup and validation

## Current Status
- Memory bank documentation: Complete
- Project structure planning: In progress
- Content creation: Not started
- Testing framework: Not started

## Risk Mitigation
- **Content Quality**: Establish review process early
- **Exam Relevance**: Regular alignment with current CKAD curriculum
- **Technical Accuracy**: Mandatory cluster testing for all questions
- **Community Adoption**: Clear contribution guidelines and templates
